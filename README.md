Data Structures and Algorithms
===========================

The content of this repo will contain a variety of code that deals with data structures and algorithms.

I have no formal background in studying computer science thus I lack a proper understanding of algorithms and data structures. So I am using [Algorithms, 4th Edition ](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ "Algorithms 4th Edition") by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne and [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do "Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript") by Michael McMillan. Exercises from the books will be stored here. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

I'm reading a JS algorithms book because I use Javascript a lot at work and need to be a better informed developer.
